Slide 3: Introduction
Road Lane Detection

Road lane detection is crucial for autonomous driving systems.
It ensures that vehicles stay within their lanes and follow the road correctly.
This project uses computer vision techniques to detect road lanes in real-time.
Slide 4: Problem Statement
Challenges in Road Lane Detection

Varying lighting conditions (day, night, shadows).
Occlusions from other vehicles and road markings.
The need for real-time processing and accuracy.
Handling different road types and lane markings.
Slide 5: Proposed Solution
Objective

Develop a robust and efficient road lane detection system using OpenCV.
Approach

Implement edge detection using Canny.
Define a region of interest to focus on the road area.
Apply Hough Transform for line detection.
Average detected lines to create stable lane markers.
Slide 6: Flowchart
Algorithm Flowchart

Capture Video Frame
Preprocess the Frame (Grayscale and Gaussian Blur)
Perform Canny Edge Detection
Apply Region of Interest Mask
Detect Lines using Hough Transform
Average Detected Lines
Overlay Lane Lines on Original Frame
Display the Result
Slide 7: Detailed Working Flowchart
Step-by-Step Process

Start
Initialize video capture from a file.
Capture Video Frame
Read frames one by one from the video.
Preprocessing
Convert each frame to grayscale.
Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
Perform Canny edge detection to highlight edges.
Region of Interest Selection
Define a polygonal mask to focus on the road area.
Apply the mask to the edge-detected image.
Line Detection using Hough Transform
Detect lines in the masked image using the Hough Transform method.
Line Averaging
Separate lines into left and right lanes.
Average the lines to create a single line for each lane.
Overlay Detected Lines
Draw the averaged lane lines on the original frame.
Display Result
Combine the original frame with the lane lines and display.
End
Slide 8: Preprocessing
Grayscale Conversion and Gaussian Blur

Grayscale Conversion
Simplifies the image by reducing color information, focusing on intensity.
Gaussian Blur
Reduces noise and smooths the image, which helps in edge detection.
Canny Edge Detection

Detects edges by looking for areas of rapid intensity change.
Uses two thresholds to identify strong and weak edges.
Slide 9: Region of Interest
Defining the Region of Interest

Focuses on the lower part of the image where lane lines are likely to appear.
Uses a polygonal mask to isolate the area of interest.
Applies the mask to the edge-detected image to filter out irrelevant edges.
Slide 10: Line Detection
Hough Transform for Line Detection

Detects straight lines in the masked edge-detected image.
Uses parameters like distance resolution, angle resolution, and threshold to find lines.
Returns lines in the form of endpoints (x1, y1, x2, y2).
Slide 11: Line Averaging
Averaging Detected Lines

Separates detected lines into left and right lanes based on their slope.
Averages the slopes and intercepts of lines to create a single line for each lane.
Converts the averaged line parameters back to endpoints for drawing.
Slide 12: Results
Overlaying and Displaying Lane Lines

Draws the averaged lane lines on a blank image.
Combines the lane lines image with the original frame using weighted addition.
Displays the final result with detected lane lines overlaid on the original video frame.
Slide 13: Conclusion
